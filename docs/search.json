    "text": "The overlap of Christian music with post rock becomes more apparent the more I listen to both. The melodic sounds, slow build ups, and explosive climax. This song has three of them. The last one culminates after about 10 minutes of soft, melodic worship into a build up and release that I’d say brings me closer to God than any other song I’ve listened to (see my point about this here). Towards the end of the build up at the 23:25 mark, the camera goes to the drummer–there’s something about his face, his passion, that makes me look forward to that specific shot everytime I watch it. It’s the best video on the internet. Period. Watch and immerse yourself for all 23 minutes and you’ll see why."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Even though I’m a big math rock fan, I only recently discovered standards. All their albums are awesome and the fruit theme gives it an extra happy vibe that matches the music. But the part that makes them special is how technical the music actually is, yet it’s chill and relaxed enough that you could play it in any room. That is definitely not the case for all math rock. Bubble Bath sticks out for me because of its almost “cheesy” dance-like opening melody, but there’s this underlying emotion and fullness in the guitar. He’s not just playing it on one string–you can hear him hitting multiple strings as his fingers slide around. That lasts the whole song. But the part that really does it is the transition from the main melody to this other part (listen at 1:29), particularly where he does a little run half way through the measure. The other cool thing is how this run part only happens every other time (listen at 0:35)."

    "text": "The title of this album is Evidence. I would argue that not only is this song about the evidence of God, but the song itself is too. I have this theory, stemming from the fact that you feel Him more or less with certain sounds, that there exists sounds that maximally elicit his presence. The closer you are to finding those sounds the more he is physically there with you. At some point, the music is him. The opposite is also true."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Vasudeva is one of my favorite (if not thee favorite) mathy post rock bands. If there is one word to describe their music, it is “hope”. There is a relentless optimism in the sounds, yet it has deep emotion. This is particularly noticable when you listen to No Clearance (the name of this album) all the way through. The song “Turnstile” is my favorite on the album, and part of it is how it transitions from “Slowboy” as it feels like they just needed to continue even though the song is over. Like your optimism starts fading so they say, “we’re not done yet” and give you a little bit more."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Tommy Boys is one of the most under-the-radar bands in pop/punk/math rock, probably because they just released one album in 2015 then I never heard from them again. The reason Estate Sale is especially great is because of this music video (above). If you know the album version, you’ll know that the three choruses are more or less the same. But in the music video at the 2:13 timepoint (in the third chorus) the singer emphasizes the “day” in “Saturday”, which honestly makes the whole song."
