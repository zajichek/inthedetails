    "text": "The title of this album is Evidence. I would argue that not only is this song about the evidence of God, but the song itself is too. I have this theory, stemming from the fact that you feel Him more or less with certain sounds, that there exists sounds that maximally elicit his presence. The closer you are to finding those sounds the more he is physically there with you. At some point, the music is him. The opposite is also true."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Tommy Boys is one of the most under-the-radar bands in pop/punk/math rock, probably because they just released one album in 2015 then I never heard from them again. The reason Estate Sale is especially great is because of this music video (above). If you know the album version, you’ll know that the three choruses are more or less the same. But in the music video at the 2:13 timepoint (in the third chorus) the singer emphasizes the “day” in “Saturday”, which honestly makes the whole song."
