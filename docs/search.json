    "text": "Tommy Boys is one of the most under-the-radar bands in pop/punk/math rock, probably because they just released one album in 2015 then I never heard from them again. The reason Estate Sale is especially great is because of this music video (above). If you know the album version, you’ll know that the three choruses are more or less the same. But in the music video at the 2:13 timepoint (in the third chorus) the singer emphasizes the “day” in “Saturday”, which honestly makes the whole song."

    "text": "Vasudeva is one of my favorite (if not thee favorite) mathy post rock bands. If there is one word to describe their music, it is “hope”. There is a relentless optimism in the sounds, yet it has deep emotion. This is particularly noticable when you listen to No Clearance (the name of this album) all the way through. The song “Turnstile” is my favorite on the album, and part of it is how it transitions from “Slowboy” as it feels like they just needed to continue even though the song is over. Like your optimism starts fading so they say, “we’re not done yet” and give you a little bit more."

    "text": "Even though I’m a big math rock fan, I only recently discovered standards. All their albums are awesome and the fruit theme gives it an extra happy vibe that matches the music. But the part that makes them special is how technical the music actually is, yet it’s chill and relaxed enough that you could play it in any room. That is definitely not the case for all math rock. Bubble Bath sticks out for me because of its almost “cheesy” dance-like opening melody, but there’s this underlying emotion and fullness in the guitar. He’s not just playing it on one string–you can hear him hitting multiple strings as his fingers slide around. That lasts the whole song. But the part that really does it is the transition from the main melody to this other part (listen at 1:29), particularly where he does a little run half way through the measure. The other cool thing is how this run part only happens every other time (listen at 0:35)."

    "text": "This is the toned-down acoustic version of the album version, but it’s one of the best live performances of any song. The reason it’s so good is because of just that: the small, intimate crowd makes it seem like everyone is singing along and performing together, which is explicit in this part. You can tell there’s just a lot of passion and nostalgia in the room the entire song. Also, the backing singer has an incredible voice."

    "text": "A while back I randomly stumbled on this reaction video of this Cory Asbury song, for whatever reason. After watching that, then proceeding to watch the entire original video above, I got hooked on this theme of live Christian rock performances that I now listen to regularly (e.g., Elevation Worship, Churchome, Bethel Music, TRIBL). The music and energy in this performance is obviously one reason why I like it, but what also makes it great is the topic of the song: The Parable of the Lost Sheep.\n\n“Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus. 2 But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.” 3 Then Jesus told them this parable: 4 “Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? 5 And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders 6 and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.’ 7 I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.”\n\nFor some reason, this one hit home. So much so that I bought a picture representation of it to hang on my wall (and I’m not one to care much about decorating). Oh, and his Dave Matthews-esque vibe with a hoodie and Yankees hat singing about Jesus (even though Matthews doesn’t wear either of those that I’ve seen) made me like it even more."

    "text": "The title of this album is Evidence. I would argue that not only is this song about the evidence of God, but the song itself is too. I have this theory, stemming from the fact that you feel Him more or less with certain sounds, that there exists sounds that maximally elicit his presence. The closer you are to finding those sounds the more he is physically there with you. At some point, the music is him. The opposite is also true."

    "text": "I’d be surprised if someone knows this song/band…except Look Mexico. I stumbled on Summer Darling in a total coincidence: I had been listening to “Math is Everywhere” by Look Mexico for a few years, and then at some point I read that it was a cover (don’t remember where), so I dug around to find the original artist, and figured out it was Summer Darling. It turned out to be the last song on their first album from 2004. Then I started listening to this album and “Arsonist Blues” stuck out the most. It has late 90’s/early 2000’s summer nostalgia written all over it. The story, the sound, and the lyrics all make it seem like something we should have been listening to a long time ago."

    "text": "My favorite song of all time. Even though “Never Meant” is considered thee all-time classic emo song (and don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love it), I actually prefer American Football’s comeback albums from 2016 and 2019. It’s something about the maturity of the music/lyrics that is much deeper (and relatable) at this stage of life. In the 1999 album, the songs reflected their struggles as they were at the time of their college-aged selves. Now they’re all 40+ year old dads still singing about life, but it dwarfs the silly issues they thought they had when they were younger. You also notice that in the original album cover they’re looking at the house from the outside looking in. In 2016 it’s looking from the inside looking out. This song in particular sticks out, first of all, because of the lyrical content, which to me just feels all too relatable. But also because of the bridge (see 2:28). It doesn’t seem that special at first, but the technicality of the timing of the guitar part as the bass comes in just sounds like something you don’t hear too often. Like they have two different time signatures running together, which sounds contradicting and confusing, but it ends up being the perfect build up to the ending."

    "text": "The overlap of Christian music with post rock becomes more apparent the more I listen to both. The melodic sounds, slow build ups, and explosive climax. This song has three of them. The last one culminates after about 10 minutes of soft, melodic worship into a build up and release that I’d say brings me closer to God than any other song I’ve listened to (see my point about this here). Towards the end of the build up at the 23:25 mark, the camera goes to the drummer–there’s something about his face, his passion, that makes me look forward to that specific shot everytime I watch it. It’s the best video on the internet. Period. Watch and immerse yourself for all 23 minutes and you’ll see why."
