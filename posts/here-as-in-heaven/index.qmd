The title of this album is _Evidence_. I would argue that not only is this song _about_ the evidence of God, but the song _itself_ is too. I have this theory, stemming from the fact that you feel Him more or less with certain sounds, that there exists sounds that maximally elicit his presence. The closer you are to finding those sounds the more he is physically there with you. At some point, the music _is_ him. The opposite is also true.
