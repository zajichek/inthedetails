This is the perfect closer from their most recent full-length album from 2019. Just immediately the tone of the guitars are filled with deep emotion, which gets even more amplified as the bass and drums come in (see [0:54](https://youtu.be/5tkFaQzGoMc?list=RD5tkFaQzGoMc&t=54)). As the vocals come in (see [2:03](https://youtu.be/5tkFaQzGoMc?list=RD5tkFaQzGoMc&t=123)), the song feels like longing, contemplation and desperation, and that's made explict with lines like:

> "I'm looking for the words that I've lost on you. Been digging in the dirt. Now I'm buried in reminiscence."
