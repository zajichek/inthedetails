Tommy Boys is one of the most under-the-radar bands in pop/punk/math rock, probably because they just released [one album in 2015](https://www.discogs.com/release/15410668-Tommy-Boys-Tommy-Boys?srsltid=AfmBOopGJSSm1BOctYeJnykSH6RycpnwuShFSpyQoKzy-bDAqELYA4Lq) then I never heard from them again. The reason _Estate Sale_ is especially great is because of this music video (above). If you know the [album version](https://open.spotify.com/track/31uYjykjYtP5WsnGoNPXa5?si=81b738a3d2b94e9a), you'll know that the three choruses are more or less the same. But in the music video at the [2:13 timepoint](https://youtu.be/R6Vckk54Abw?list=RDR6Vckk54Abw&t=132) (in the third chorus) the singer emphasizes the "day" in "Saturday", which honestly makes the whole song.
