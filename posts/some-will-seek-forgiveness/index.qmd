I've listened to Underoath since 6th or 7th grade. This is their best song on their best album (even though I definitely didn't used to think that). Usually it's refreshing nowadays when you see older bands from your younger days release comeback albums with a more Christian and/or mature tilt. Unfortunately it seems Underoath is taking the opposite approach and moving away from all that as they get older, which is disappointing and paradoxical.
