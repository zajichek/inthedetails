I'd be surprised if someone knows this song/band...except [Look Mexico](http://www.lookmexico.net/). I stumbled on [Summer Darling](https://open.spotify.com/artist/18wxWzyhiQbISIrYjQ67kk?si=QAwWFr2vQvOCBQdtq_w8IQ) in a total coincidence: I had been listening to ["_Math is Everywhere_"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eao7yvlP6Js) by [Look Mexico](http://www.lookmexico.net/) for a few years, and then at some point I read that it was a cover (don't remember where), so I dug around to find the original artist, and figured out it was [Summer Darling](https://open.spotify.com/artist/18wxWzyhiQbISIrYjQ67kk?si=QAwWFr2vQvOCBQdtq_w8IQ). It turned out to be the [last song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3ofTxVsJ0JoGORhSRwXhfh?si=3a0c800fe8114e43) on their [first album from 2004](https://open.spotify.com/album/4L2MK4TfIWBK9kjnjPdlkj?si=NkAPW3DjTmKFH0St-Hmu0A). Then I started listening to this album and ["_Arsonist Blues_"](https://open.spotify.com/track/64mS5U8Er3fqfxLAitjpjx?si=90b8c3b9a36144d1) stuck out the most. It has late 90's/early 2000's summer nostalgia written all over it. The story, the sound, and the lyrics all make it seem like something we should have been listening to a long time ago.
