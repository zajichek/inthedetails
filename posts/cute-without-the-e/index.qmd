This is the toned-down acoustic version of the [album version](https://open.spotify.com/track/6OyKBwLzq4h15XmxeWf5n4?si=569052ed06434392), but it's one of the best live performances of any song. The reason it's so good is because of just that: the small, intimate crowd makes it seem like everyone is singing along and performing together, which is explicit in [this part](https://youtu.be/sWmxAQVNIYw?list=RDsWmxAQVNIYw&t=148). You can tell there's just a lot of passion and nostalgia in the room the entire song. Also, the backing singer has an incredible voice.
