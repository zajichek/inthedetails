The overlap of Christian music with post rock becomes more apparent the more I listen to both. The melodic sounds, slow build ups, and explosive climax. This song has three of them. The last one [culminates](https://youtu.be/_fY3l9AKPa0?list=RD_fY3l9AKPa0&t=1195) after about 10 minutes of soft, melodic worship into a build up and release that I'd say brings me closer to God than any other song I've listened to (see my point about this [here](https://zajichek.github.io/inthedetails/posts/here-as-in-heaven/)). Towards the end of the build up at the [23:25](https://youtu.be/_fY3l9AKPa0?list=RD_fY3l9AKPa0&t=1286) mark, the camera goes to the drummer--there's something about his face, his passion, that makes me look forward to that specific shot everytime I watch it. It's the best video on the internet. Period. Watch and immerse yourself for all 23 minutes and you'll see why.
